## 2. How We Use Your Information

QuickAid uses your information solely to provide its core features:

- Send prompts and optional screenshots to **OpenAI’s API** for generating responses.
- Display those responses in the live QuickAid overlay.

We do not log, transmit, or store any personal or session data outside of your local device.

## 3. Data Storage & Security

- Your **OpenAI key** remains in your browser and is never shared.
- Transcripts and screenshots are **temporarily processed** only while the extension is active.
